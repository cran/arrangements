Description: Fast generators and iterators for permutations, combinations,
    integer partitions and compositions. The arrangements are in
    lexicographical order and generated iteratively in a memory efficient manner. 
    It has been demonstrated that 'arrangements' outperforms most existing
    packages of similar kind. Benchmarks could be found at
