Fast generators and iterators for permutations, combinations, integer
partitions and compositions. The arrangements are in lexicographical
order and generated iteratively in a memory efficient manner. It has
been demonstrated that ‘arrangements’ outperforms most existing packages
of similar kind. Benchmarks could be found at
<https://randy3k.github.io/arrangements/articles/benchmark.html>.
