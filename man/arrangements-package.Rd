\title{arrangements: Fast Generators and Iterators for Permutations, Combinations and Partitions}
\description{
Fast generators and iterators for permutations, combinations
    and partitions. The iterators allow users to generate arrangements in 
    a memory efficient manner and the generated arrangements are in 
    lexicographical (dictionary) order. Permutations and combinations can 
    be drawn with/without replacement and support multisets. It has been 
    demonstrated that 'arrangements' outperforms most of the existing 
    packages of similar kind. Some benchmarks could be found at 
    <https://randy3k.github.io/arrangements/articles/benchmark.html>.
